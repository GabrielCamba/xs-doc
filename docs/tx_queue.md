# Transaction queue

The Transaction Queue is available for access through either the dashboard or the transactions page. Within this queue, multisig account compiles and displays a catalog of pending transactions awaiting signatures from owners. These transactions persist in the queue until the multisig's predetermined threshold is achieved.
The transaction summary provides a concise overview, including a brief description of the transaction, its creation date and time, the destination address and a fraction such as (1/2), indicating that one signatory has endorsed the transaction, while the approval threshold is set at two.

*Important: The multisig can have a maximum of up to 10 transactions in queue*
