# How to send tokens

There are two ways to do a transfer of tokens in a multisig account.
1. From the **Assets** page: you can choose the asset you want to transfer pressing on the button next to it called **Transfer**
2. From the button **New transaction:** you can find the button **New transaction** in the lateral bar and choose the option called **Send tokens.**


## Step 1
A new page called **Send tokens** will be loaded. If you start the action to transfer from the first option, you are going to see the asset selected automatically in the dropdown. Opposite case, a random asset will be set as default.


## Step 2
You have to set the Shibuya address which will receive the token. In the last dropdown, you will have to choose from a list of assets loaded in the multisig account and set a valid amount. Once all the fields are loaded, the **Next** button will be enabled.


## Step 3
After pressing on the next button, you will see a preview of the transaction to check the recipient address and the asset to be sent.


## Step 4
Your signature will be requested from the wallet extension that you are using (in this case, you can see the request from the Subwallet extension)


## Step 5
When you approve the transaction, you will see a success message detailing the hash of the transaction (which you can find in the **Transactions** page) and the balance of the selected asset will be updated in the origin and receiver address.
